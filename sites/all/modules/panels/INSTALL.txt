Place the module files in the appropriate directory. If you're not sure,
try 'sites/all/modules'. 

Then navigate to administer >> site building >> modules and activate
the panels module, along with any of the accompanying side modules you'd like to use.
The Panels module itself only provides an API - you MUST install these other modules
if you want to do much of anything.
